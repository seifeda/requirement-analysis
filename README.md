# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## Introduction  
This repository, **requirement-analysis**, is created to explore and document the key concepts, processes, and practices involved in **Requirement Analysis** within the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
The goal of this project is to understand how clear, accurate, and validated requirements contribute to building successful software systems that meet stakeholder needs and expectations.

## What is Requirement Analysis?  
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It serves as the foundation of the software development process, ensuring that the final product aligns with user requirements and business objectives.  

### Importance in SDLC  
Requirement Analysis acts as the bridge between stakeholders and developers. It minimizes misunderstandings, reduces project risks, and ensures that development efforts are focused on delivering the right functionality. Without proper requirement analysis, projects are likely to face issues such as scope creep, cost overruns, or failure to meet user needs.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase** in the SDLC for several reasons:  

1. **Prevents Miscommunication:**  
   It ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of project goals, features, and limitations.  

2. **Reduces Development Costs and Rework:**  
   Detecting issues or unclear requirements early in the process is far less costly than fixing them during or after implementation.  

3. **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction:**  
   Well-defined requirements help create software that aligns with user expectations and business objectives, leading to a more successful and high-quality final product.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

The Requirement Analysis phase typically includes the following key activities:  

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and documents to understand their needs and expectations.  

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Engaging stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to draw out detailed requirements.  

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Recording requirements in a clear, structured, and understandable format such as SRS (Software Requirement Specification).  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Analyzing requirements for completeness, feasibility, and consistency, and creating visual models like data flow diagrams or use case diagrams.  

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Verifying and validating requirements with stakeholders to ensure they correctly reflect the intended functionality and business goals.

## Types of Requirements  

### 1. Functional Requirements  
Functional Requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific functionalities and behaviors of the software.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**  
- The system should allow users to **search for available rooms** by date and location.  
- The system should enable users to **book a room** and receive an **email confirmation**.  
- The system should allow administrators to **add, update, or remove room details**.  

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements  
Non-Functional Requirements describe **how the system performs** its functions, focusing on quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**  
- The system should **respond to user actions within 2 seconds**.  
- The booking data should be **encrypted** to ensure privacy and security.  
- The platform should support **at least 1000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.

## Use Case Diagrams  

**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify the system’s functionality from a user perspective and define system boundaries.  

### Benefits:  
- Clarifies system scope and functionality.  
- Helps identify main actors and their interactions with the system.  
- Serves as a communication tool between developers and stakeholders.  

### Example: Booking Management System Use Case Diagram  

Below is a use case diagram for a simple booking management system:

**Actors:**  
- **Customer:** Searches, books, and pays for rooms.  
- **Admin:** Manages room information and booking records.  
- **Payment System:** Processes customer payments securely.

## Acceptance Criteria  

**Acceptance Criteria** are predefined conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders or product owners. They ensure that the developed features work as expected and meet business needs.  

### Importance:  
- Ensures clarity on feature expectations.  
- Provides a basis for testing and validation.  
- Defines the boundaries of functionality for each user story.  

### Example: Checkout Feature (Booking Management System)  

**Feature:** User completes a booking payment through the checkout process.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The user must be able to view a summary of the booking before confirming payment.  
2. The system must calculate and display the total cost, including taxes and fees.  
3. The user must be able to select a payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.).  
4. A confirmation message and booking reference must appear after successful payment.  
5. An email receipt must be sent to the user automatically after checkout.
